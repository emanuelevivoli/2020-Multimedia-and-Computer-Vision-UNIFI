# Introduction
This folder contains code and documentations for the project "Compression Reconstruction Loss for Super-Resolution Images with GAN" assigned in the class "Multimedia and Computer Vision" 2020/2021.

The project is based on a PyTorch implementation of SRGAN which re-implemented CVPR 2017 paper [Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802).

# Requirements
